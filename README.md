**Task**: Build an expense tracking application

**Technologies**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/)

## Features:
- **Sign In/Sign Out**: User should be able to sign in/out to their account (can be a mocked service using localstorage, but could also be connected to something like firebase).
- **Balance View**: Users should be able to view their current balance, which is updated in real-time as transactions are added.
- **Transaction Management**: Users should be able to add new transactions, categorizing them as either expenses or income. Each transaction also includes a short description for easy reference.
- **Transaction History**: Users should be able to view their past transactions, providing a clear overview of their financial activity.
- **Responsive Design**: The application should be responsive for various devices with different screen sizes.

## Notes:
- There is no defined UI, the functionality is most important
- It would be useful if the layout was made using [Grid](https://mantine.dev/core/grid/) and [Flex](https://mantine.dev/core/flex/) to get familiar with the concepts
